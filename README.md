# Deprecated

Please use [SDL-in-LuaJIT-for-android](https://github.com/thenumbernine/SDL-in-LuaJIT-android) instead, unless all you want is a very focused app solely for running SDL LuaJIT on Android.

I made this initially to directly connect the SDL-android project to LuaJIT for running SDL-driven scripts in LuaJIT.

It does not do much more than this.  Namely, it is a bit painful to access the UI of Android.

However since then I developed [lua-java](https://github.com/thenumbernine) and connected it to a purely [LuaJIT android](https://github.com/thenumbernine/LuaJIT-android) project.  Now you can script the Android and its Java API but all with just LuaJIT.  No compiler, no stupid bloated Google tools.

From there, I built off the LuaJIT-android project a SDL-specific variant, which is [SDL-in-LuaJIT-for-android](https://github.com/thenumbernine/SDL-in-LuaJIT-android).  This one has the flexibility of using LuaJIT to build and run the whole of the UI and of the Java side of things, and also uses LuaJIT for the SDL Activity launcher, on a separate thread.

# SDL+LuaJIT Launcher for Android

This is an Android app with SDL + LuaJIT packaged.

Why SDL?  Because last I checked, the hardware surface creation of Android is tied so closely to the app, which is tied to java, so using SDL's Android demo is a good starting point.

Why LuaJIT?  Because I don't want to write code in Java or C++.

This app is as minimal as possible, it creates the surface, launches LuaJIT, and that's that.

Included is a LuaJIT script for launching under Android which redirects stdout/stderr to a file (since Android OS throws stdout away smh),
chdir's to files (idk maybe it is there by default), and adjusts some library locations to be so's in files/.

# Installing

1) Build.  With AndroidStudio.  Try not to get it to crash.  Hahaha. And then deploy.

2) Create a `luajit-args` file with args to run.
2) Then `adb push luajit-args /data/data/io.github.thenumbernine.SDLLuaJIT/files/`

3) If you are telling it to launch a file or do anything with the filesystem outside its files/ folder, i.e. in the `/sdcard` folder, you will have to go to app permissions and give it all-file permissions.

If all goes well then maybe I'll merge it with `lua-dist` and make it one of the other alternatives alongside win64, linux64, osx, and appimage. But things probably won't go well because the Android development environment is famous for being a giant pile of shit.  Which is why each of those platforms' distributable packages take a script of a few kb to build, while Android needs GIGABYTES to do the equivalent, and do it poorly.

# Want Extra Libraries?

I have been copying binaries from Termux, which at least for me happens to be armv7a.
So to get them working all I have to do is `patchelf` then change the library name, dependency names, and rpath.
I've been setting the `rpath` to `$ORIGIN/../files` which happens to resolve to the `files/` folder, and then putting them all there, because Android lets me link libraries there, not so much for other locations.

I've generated LuaJIT bindings to go with most POSIX functions of Termux's android, it's in my `lua-ffi-bindings` project in the `Android/c` folder.

# under the hood

First the Activity UI thread creates the UI Lua state and runs the `/data/data/io.github.thenumbernine.SDLLuaJIT/files/luajit-ui-main.lua` file's main method, with either of the messages: "init", "pause", "resume". (The file is only loaded into this Lua state once).

Next the SDLMain thread launches into LuaJIT, basically the `luajit.c` CLI itself, and runs whatever arguments are provided in `/data/data/io.github.thenumbernine.SDLLuaJIT/files/luajit-args`.

From there, LuaJIT can access any C function just fine.

The JNIEnv of the UI thread and of the SDLMain thread can be accessed via LuaJIT FFI.  My [lua-java](https://github.com/thenumbernine/lua-java) can then be used to do any sort of Java stuff from within LuaJIT.

The two LuaJIT states can access and talk to one another using my [lua-lua](http://github.com/thenumbernine/lua-lua) LuaJIT module, and [lua-thread](https://github.com/thenumbernine/lua-thread) for synchronization.

# TODO

- connect the luajit build scripts to the CMakeLists.txt to have it build luajit through Android Studio instead of as a separate shell script.
- automated script in my lua-dist project for auto-generating the Android build files for some particular appname/classname, and auto-package the luajit contents, to auto-build Android apps:
	- 1) sed all the io.github.thenumbernine.SDLActivity with whatever apk classname for the specific repo
	- 3) setup luajit-args to the init/boostrap file
	- 4) copy the dist package dir over to the /data/data/app/files/
- add a text console output, for non-graphics scripts, pipe stdout/stderr into it, and only create the SDL surface upon SDL request.
- builtin settings to edit the CLI args, option to disable for when using this to package specific apps.
- add a new luajit package.loaders for loading files off the APK so I don't have to copy the whole apk files contents over and over again...
- move the redirection of stdout into the java or luajit.c code and out of the luajit-lua code so it is only done once-per-process.
- move the setting of env vars out of the java code and into the luajit-lua code.
- maybe make a spinoff app that is this but without SDL side, so it is all 100% luajit... er 99% luajit and 1% minimal Android project files.
